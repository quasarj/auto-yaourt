## Auto-Yaourt
Simple yaourt install script (for Arch).

### Instructions
Ensure you have wget and sudo installed, and you can use sudo. 
You could probably also run this as root, but I wouldn't suggest it.

Paste this into your terminal:

    wget -O - http://github.com/quasarj/auto-yaourt/... | sh
